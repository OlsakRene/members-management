## Usage

**For API**, I used POSTMAN and added **Content-Type: application/json** and **Accept: application/json** to headers

### **Example for creating user with JSON in for example POSTMAN:**
```bash
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "birth_date": "1990-01-01",
  "tags": [1,2,3]
}
```

### **Example for creating tag:**
```bash
{
  "name": "VIP",
}
```
